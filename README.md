Presenting the Automated Design Maker for printing businesses!

I originally built this project for a printing business. 
The owners would constantly make generic designs to put on Etsy or to show to customers which took a great amount of time using Illustrator and Photoshop.
I decided to make this program to help automate the design process saving heaps of time for the owners.

So it works like this:
First you upload a font for your designs.
Second you upload a CSV file that contains the text, where each design is on a new line.
